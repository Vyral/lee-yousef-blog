excerpt: "I wanted to give you an update on the new tax changes to the principal residence program, because they affect all residents of Canada. These changes were brought about to prevent foreign investors taking advantage of tax loopholes, but the new changes extend beyond just investors. The CRA will now require all sales to be reported on your tax return, regardless of whether you owe taxes or not from the principal residence exemption. If you don't report a sale or you fail to designate your primary residence, you could wind up paying thousands of dollars in penalties. For more details on this new change, watch this short video."
