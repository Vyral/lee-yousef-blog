We're seeing a mixed bag, but overall, the market is down a bit. This leaves an opportunity open for certain people, however.

When we look at the market, we like to compare data like benchmark price from this year to the same time last year. Let's take a look at the how they have change in our surrounding area this month compared to last year:

Hillhurst is up 1%

Ramsey is up 5%

Beltline is down 13%

Hamptons is unchanged

Rosedale is up 3%

Varsity is down 6%

Coral Springs is down 10%

Silverado is down 6%

Aspend Woods is down 3%

Lake Bonavista is up 3%

Cranston is down 7%

Sherwood is up 1%

Airdrie is down 4%

Okotoks is down 1%

Chestermere is down 2%

Cochrane is down 4%

It's a mixed bag as you can see, and overall the market is down. However, there are hot spots throughout the city. It's a good time to buy, because unlike two years ago, you don't have to fight with other buyers to overpay for a house and have to make a decision in two days! Now, you can actually have fun with it and drive around to look at homes and find the best ones available. You can still take advantage of low interest rates, too.

These favorable conditions won't last forever, though. I would encourage you to take advantage of them while you can! If you'd like an update on a specific community that we didn't discuss today, give me a call or send me an email. I'd be happy to answer your questions and give you any information you need.
